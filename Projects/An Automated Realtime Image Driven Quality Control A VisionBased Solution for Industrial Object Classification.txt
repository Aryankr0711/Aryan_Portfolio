Title-  An Automated Realtime Image Driven Quality Control: A Vision-Based Solution for Industrial Object Classification

This project, "An Automated Realtime Image Driven Quality Control," is a vision-based solution designed to enhance quality inspection
 in industrial environments. Using OpenCV and other image processing techniques, the system automatically detects and classifies
 objects by their shape, size, and colour with a high accuracy of 94.34%. I developed this as a hardware-independent, full-stack web
 application with a Flask backend and React frontend, which provides a user-friendly and efficient platform for quality control.

Key Expertise- Image Processing, OpenCV, BG Removal, API, Dataset Preparation & Preprocessing, Performance Optimisation & Testing
