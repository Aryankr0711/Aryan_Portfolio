Title- Player Coordinate Prediction During Pass Plays Using an Ensemble Machine Learning Technique

This project predicts the future field positions of football players using tracking data from NFL games. Features such as speed, acceleration, and distance are used to train Boosting models for X and Y coordinates. Model accuracy is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R². metrics. With the Least RMSE of 0.950 for the CatBoost Model. The system provides highly reliable movement forecasts that can support real-time sports analytics and decision-making.
