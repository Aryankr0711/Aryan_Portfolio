Title- SketchAI- Text to Image Generation using Stable Diffusion model

Created a generative AI project that uses the v1.5 Stable Diffusion model to produce high-quality images from text prompts. This
 involved a deep dive into the model's architecture, including text encoding, the diffusion process, and working within latent space to
 optimise performance. The project showcases my ability to apply advanced AI models to creative and practical applications.
